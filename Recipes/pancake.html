    <h1>Protein Pancakes</h1>
    <h2>Ingredient list</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One scoop of protein powder of choice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup oats</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon coconut flour</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 Teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 banana</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Make the oat flour.</strong>Add rolled oats to your blender and blend for 10-15 seconds until it is broken down into a flour-like consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Combine your dry ingredients. </strong>Add oat flour, protein powder, coconut flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl and mix well to combine.</li>
      <li><strong>Mix your wet ingredients.</strong>In a separate medium bowl, mash your bananas until smooth. Add your egg, and milk and mix well to combine. Add your dry ingredients to your wet ingredients and mix until absorbed and lumps are gone. Try not to overmix. The batter should be pretty thick. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Cook.</strong> Heat up a large nonstick skillet or griddle over low to medium heat. Once hot, add cooking fat and let it warm up. Using a 1/4 cup as a scoop, form into equal size pancakes. I get about 5 (you may need to cook in batches depending on how big your pan is). Cook for 3-4 minutes until small bubbles start to form on the outside. There won't be a lot of bubbles. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
      <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Top with your favorite toppings and enjoy!</li>
